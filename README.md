## Development

1. Install all project dependencies with `yarn`
2. Adjust your `project.json` file.
3. Start your webpack-dev-server for debugging your project with `yarn start`

    > The webpack-dev-server is now running on your localhost on the port 8080. If the port is not available you can change it in the `webpack.config.js`.

    > `yarn start` runs the server in HTTPS mode.

4. Enable eslint in your development environment. _(not necessary, but recommended)_
